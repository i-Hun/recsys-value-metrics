# MERS: Metrics for economic recommender systems

Metrics selection based on paragraph 5.2 from the article ["Economic Recommender Systems â€“ A Systematic Review"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11998.pdf).

## Value at k

Value at position k is the revenue or profit from relevant items in the recommendations list.

$$Value@k=\sum_{u\in U}\sum^{k}_{j=1}rel^{Y}_{u,j}\cdot p_{j}$$

## Profit-At-Hit

PAH@k indicates the overall profit generated by the recommendation per user divided by the number of items sold;

$$PAH@k=\frac{1}{|U|}\cdot\frac{Profit@k}{Volume@k}=\frac{1}{|U|}\cdot\frac{Profit(true\ positive\ at\ k)}{|true\ positive\ at\ k|}$$

## Expected profit at k

Expected Profit at position k is the statistical profit it is expected to achieve by the recommendations considering the expected user interest $\hat{x}_{u,j}(\Theta)$.

$$EP@k=\sum_{u\in U}\sum^{k}_{j=1}\hat{x}_{u,j}(\Theta)\cdot v_{j}$$

## P-NDCG@k

Price-Based Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain  at position k is defined as $NDCG@k$, where the gain is given by the items price. In the equation, $P-IDCG_u@k$ is the Price-Based Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain obtained by sorting the prices of all relevant items to the user in descending order.

$$P-NDCG@k=\frac{1}{|U|}\sum_{u\in U}\frac{\sum^{k}_{j=1}\frac{rel^y_{u,j}\cdot p_j}{log_2(j+1)}}{P-IDCG_u@k}$$
